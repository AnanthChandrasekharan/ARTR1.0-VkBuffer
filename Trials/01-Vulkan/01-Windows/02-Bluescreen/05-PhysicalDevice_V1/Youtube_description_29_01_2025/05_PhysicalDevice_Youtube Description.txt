01:53 start
5:09 start with numbering
06:04 finalized number
06:32 ready for actual start
07:05: don't share links
10:29 group meeting
16:09: what to study till then and spirv assignment
23:02: completed above discussion and queries start
42:11: start with new concept
43:41: Surface discussion
44:44:  discussion on View
48:05: Presentation surface (depth denari client area) discussion  concluded
49:09: Creation of presentation surface discussion ends(to be done in code) 
49:10:  New concept
53:11 : Vkinstance chai kaam instance create karna ani pass kelele extensions enable karna

58:55: dusra mudda , Vulkan api are explicit (main point). Phyical device discussion start
01:03:09: just cikanda tithe copuy karayla hi Vulkan ok aahe
01:05:18: end of old disucssion
01:05:59: Physical device milala theorywise , 
Compared with OpenGL to get device context , In Vulkan device context is logical device
01:07:24: Physical device to logical device means what , je pan karaycha aahe grahics work , ciompute work , transfer work , accelarator work , make commands for it. 

Please these commands in a buffer
Message loop athva ithe
COM madhe automation madhe client ano server madhe proxy stub madhla PDU

Mag ha buffer queque madhe pathvaycha device la .
He kaam purvi driver karaycha  bar ka
Jyani Linux cha driver cha code vachla aahe , tithe list of queque aahe
OpenGL and DirectX11 madhe queque shabd pan nahi aahe
Pan Vulkan ani Directx12 madhe queque lay velela aahe , bcoz driver cha kaam aata developer karnaar aahe (so called)
Commands , queque madhunach aala  pahije

Physical device bhetla , tya madhe khup asel vegle kaam karnaare queque's
vegla kaam karnare queque's cha family milnaar
he queque cha family aahe , 10 aahet queque

He queque cha family aahe , 5 aahet queque
ekda ka kuti queue family pahije pakka zala, Eg Rendering sathi queque family pahije
 tar renderig karnerya queque cha family ghe ani tya madhe tula pahije tasa queque tayaar kar

Mag milalela physical device plus tyacha barobar tumlaha hava asel queque cha family plus tya family madhna choose kelela queque , ha combo la ekatra logical device
Logical device is a generic software concept
Mala pahije tasa mold kelela physical device mhanje lgical device
Logical device mhanje physical device with requiredqueque family and from that required queque from that family

aajcha kaam  physical device tayaar karun
queque family selection ani tya queque family cha index nivdun thevaycha
te zal pudcha lecture la logical device tayaar karuya

aaj 2 kaam
Presentation Surface

Physical device , pan nasta physical device nahi 
with its required queque family and its required queque family index

Pudcvhya veli lagech logical device cook karu shakto

01:11:39: End of main theory

01:12:12: Start of analogy
 Ek motha ghar aahe, tya madhe naukar bharti karaycha  aahe
10 naukar aale interview sathi, tyatla jevha ek naukar nivadnaar na mhanje physical device
tya naukar la kaam vicharna mhanje queque family ani tumhi jya sathi tyala vaprnaar te queque cha index
He example lakshat theva

01:13:17 : End of analogy

01:13:20: Same analogy repeated
Ek motha ghar aahe, tya madhe naukar bharti karaycha  aahe

naukrala ainterview sathi bolavla eka ghara madhe, naukar tya sathi enumerate kelet
tya peki ek la nivadla , to tumcha selected physical device zala
to selected naukar(physical device) la vicharla ki tula kay kay kaam karnyacha capability aahe

Mag to bolla ki mi ya category madhe evdha kaam karu shakto , dusra category madhe yevdi kaam karuy shakto
Mag tya madhe category nivadnaar apan (mhanjech queque family nivadna)
category madhna ek kaam nivadna mhanje queque cha index nivadna

aata ti vyakti ji yenar queuque family ani index gheun tyala to naav dya ""Cooked" bola
aala hota sadha naukart , pan aata to vishsishta kaam gheun elaborate zala
Lets say ki tyacha kade cooking cha capability aahe
aata cooking madhe bar categoryaahe
tya mmadhe ek cook karayla sangne, bakicha amhi baghu
he aahe logical device

01:15:00: Aata proper code
Directories are steps, Once done sir will be giving writing steps in detail

01:45:21: Steps for presentation surface and code for it completed

02:00: 06: uninitialize()  for above  presentation surface
02:01:07:  05-PhysicalDevice start
02:02:55 :  Brief Steps
02:07:20:  Brief steps completed, proper Steps written start

02:47:40: End of detailed step
Why such huge steps dont cause performance issues ?

02:49:28:  end of theory and start of code for 05_PhysicalDevice

03:58:35: End of 05_PhysicalDevice code

03:58:45: In steps theorotically sarv steps sangitli , pan 2 goshta ajun aahe
//https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties.html : VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties
This has 4 members:
  memoryTypeCount,memoryTypes,memoryHeapCount and memoryHeaps array
He sarv nantar staging buffer ani non staging buffermadhe lagtil , aata nahi

Dusra mhanje VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure
Prachand motha strucrture aahe. Al members of VkBool32 Type
Support aahe ka nahi asech features aahet

04:00:27 End of code and run bat file
