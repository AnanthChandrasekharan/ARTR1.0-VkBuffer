Using similar steps of getting Instance Extensions, we are going to retreive device extensions.
Variable , structure and api names are going to change

Steps to get Device extensions ?

1. 1. Find how many device extensions are supported by Vulkan driver of/for this version and keept the count in a local variable.

2. Allocate and fill struct VkExtensionProperties (https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkExtensionProperties.html) structure array, corresponding to above count

3. Fill and display a local string array of extension names obtained from VkExtensionProperties

4. As not required here onwards, free VkExtensionProperties array

5. Find whether above extension names contain our required two extensions
VK_KHR_SWAPCHAIN_EXTENSION_NAME macro
Accordingly set two global variables, "required extension count" and "required extension names array"

6. As not needed hence forth , free local string array

7. Print whether our Vulkan driver supports our required instance extension names or not (He log madhe yenar. Jithe print asel sarv log madhe yenar)

8. Print only enabled extension names
