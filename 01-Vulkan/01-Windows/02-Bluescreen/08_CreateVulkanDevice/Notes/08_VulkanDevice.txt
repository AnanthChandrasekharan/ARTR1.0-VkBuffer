This is same as logical device creation
1. Create a user defined function say CreateVulKanDevice()
2. Call previously created FillDeviceExtensionNames() in it.
3. Declare and initialize VkDeviceCreateInfo structure (https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html).
4. Use previously obtained device extension count and device extension array to initialize this structure.
5. Now call vkCreateDevice to create actual Vulkan device and do error checking.
6. Destroy this device when done. {complementary api aahe}
7. !!!!!!!!! Before destroying the device ensure that all operations on that device are finished!!!!!!!!! {synchronization related vakya}
   Till then wait on that device.
