Brief steps

Physical device enumerate karaycha jasa apan instance extensions enumerate keli hoti ani count ghyaycha kiti devices aahet(instance extensions athva)
Array declare karaycha physical devices cha , ani malloc karaycha ha count gheun
Punha Second call karaycha same api la , ani tevda count cha physical device array madhe bharun ghyayche

Till now same as instance extensions, But from now will be different

Take a bool variable bDone ani ek loop establish karaycha physical device count ani array sathi
Ek nashib aahe ki enumeration function addhich array bharte , mag loop ka lagta ?
Loop device tharvayla lagnaar aahe
So tya count itka loop establish karaycha, aat yaycha and aata steps aahet
aplyakade array aahe devices cha, aata aplyala queque famuilies milvaychat
tyamule queque familes milavnyacha quqque cha count declare karaycha ani queque family cha function parat ekda call karaycha fakt count sathi (ek single call)
Mag count milala ki aaj ajun ek array declare karaycha queque family sathi
Punha same queque familes api call karun array bharun ghyaycha
mag loop cha aat ajun ek loop establish karaycha queque cha count sathi, pan aata kashi sathi karaycha tar te queque family cha milalela array aahe tyacha indices sathi

Mag ajun ek loop establish karaycha jya madhe tya queque family cha indices aahet te milalela surface la support karta ka, he tharvayla punha loop takaycha
ani loop cha aatlya dusra loop madhe, jo array milalela aahe devices cha , tya device cha surface tumhi je magta aahe queque cha flag la support karto ka
To support karat asel tar tya index chi queque (queque index)  ani tyacha graphic card (selected graphic card) ani mag break karun baher ya

Steps
1. Declare 3 global variables , One for selected physical device, second for selected queque family index, third for physical devices memory properties(required later)
2. Call vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices() to get Physical device count
3. Allocate VkPhysicalDeviceArray object according to above count
4. Call vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices() again to fill above array
5. Start a loop using physical device count and physical device, array obtained above (Note: declare a boolean bFound variable before this loop which will decide whether we found desired physical device or not)
	Inside this loop, 
	a. Declare a local variable to hold queque count
	b. Call vkGetPhysicalDeviceQuequeFamilyProperties() to initialize above queque count variable
	c. Allocate VkQuequeFamilyProperties array according to above count
	d. Call vkGetPhysicalDeviceQuequeFamilyProperties() again to fill above array
	e. Declare VkBool32 type array and allocate it using the same above queque count
	f. Start a nested loop and fill above VkBool32 type array by calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR()
	g. Start another nested loop(not inside above loop , but nested in main loop) and check whether physical device
	   in its array with its queque family "has"(Sir told to underline) graphics bit or not. 
	   If yes then this is a selected physical device and assign it to global variable. 
	   Similarly this index is the selected queque family index and assign it to global variable too and set bFound to true
	   and break out from second nested loop
	h. Now we are back in main loop, so free queque family array and VkBool32 type array
	i. Still being in main loop, acording to bFound variable break out from main loop
	j. free physical device array 
6. Do error checking according to value of bFound
7. memset the global physical device memory property structure
8. initialize above structure by using vkGetPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties()
9. Declare a local structure variable VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures, memset it  and initialize it by calling vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures()
10. By using "tescellation shader" member of above structure check selected device's tescellation shader support
11. By using "geometry shader" member of above structure check selected device's geometry shader support
12. There is no need to free/uninitialize/destroy selected physical device?
	Bcoz later we will create Vulkan logical device which need to be destroyed and its destruction will automatically destroy selected physical device.
