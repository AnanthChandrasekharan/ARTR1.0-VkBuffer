Steps to get Instance extensions ?

1. Find how many instance extensions are supported by Vulkan driver of/for this version and keept the count in a local variable.
	1.3.296 madhe ek instance navta , je aata add zala aahe 1.4.304 madhe , VK_NV_DISPLAY_STEREO

2. Allocate and fill struct VkExtensionProperties (https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VkExtensionProperties.html) structure array, corresponding to above count

3. Fill and display a local string array of extension names obtained from VkExtensionProperties

4. As not required here onwards, free VkExtensionProperties array

5. Find whether above extension names contain our required two extensions
VK_KHR_SURFACE_EXTENSION_NAME macro
VK_KHR_WIN32_SURFACE_EXTENSION_NAME macro
Accordingly set two global variables, "required extension count" and "required extension names array"

6. As not needed hence forth , free local string array

7. Print whether our Vulkan driver supports our required instance extension names or not (He log madhe yenar. Jithe print asel sarv log madhe yenar)

8. Print only enabled extension names

Steps for Instance creation ?

Do this in initialize()
1. As explained before fill and initialize required extension names and count in 2 respective global variables (Lasst 8 steps mhanje instance cha first step)
2. Initialize struct VkApplicationInfo
3. Initialize struct VkInstanceCreateInfo by using information from Step1 and Step2
4. Call vkCreateInstance() to get VkInstance in a global variable and do error checking

Do this in uninitialize()
5. Destroy VkInstance in uninitialize()

Extra facts 
----------------> All struct, enums, types start with "Vk"  and all api's start with "vk"

----------------> Why Vulkan is better performing than OpenGL?
Because glewInit enables all extensions by default which hurts performance in OpenGL
Vulkan tells to enable only those extensions which are to be used in our application
Thus it is customizable and better performing than OpenGL

----------------> Steps 7  and 8 look same , but they are not infact they are duplicated
Step 7 prints whether extensions suported or not
Step 8 prints only supported extension names

----------------> One more fact
VK_KHR_SURFACE_EXTENSION_NAME -> This is a macro which has value "VK_KHR_surface"
VK_KHR_WIN32_SURFACE_EXTENSION_NAME -> This is a macro which has value "VK_KHR_win32_surface"
